  I started creating the game using C and the ncurses C libary, I got a mockup of the screen,
  working, I created a main menu and a function to draw the grid. Later on I limited the game,
  window to 80x24 to focus more on the mechanics of the game rather than the graphics.
  Despite this limitation I managed to get the math right (I think) for drawing the UI.

  I picked up where I left off and got to working on the main event loop and some of the
  mechanics for making the game. I had an annoying bug in the event loop where it wouldn't
  register the key correctly and perform the action, I solved this today by adding a bracket.
  
  I implemented functions to move the cursor around the game board and only the game board.

  Now hitting the escape key will drop you back to the main menu.

  I managed to map the grid out into arrays by having a struct array called ygrid in the TTY struct.
  Inside the ygrid was an array of structs called xgrid, which holds data about the grid position.
  Right now it holds bool variables for weather it's a bomb or not, weather it's been selected and
  weather it's been flagged.

  I changed the algorithim used to genrate bombs, which before generated a random number between 0 and 1,
  across every square on the grid, and if it was 1, a bomb would be placed there, since there is a limit
  to the amount of bombs, this meant the entire top half was more or less bombs. Now it generates 2 
  random numbers across every column and places a bomb there until it reaches the bomb count, this 
  makes it a lot more random.
